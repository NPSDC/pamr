Fixes in version 1.21. 
	
1. Fixed nsscv so that unclass is used instead of codes.

2. Changed pamr.list genes so that it doesn't bomb on only one
   significant gene list. Reported by Markus Ruschhaupt.

3. Fixed pamr.confusion bug that screwed up individual plots. Reported
   by Monica.

4. Long standing request of Rob Gentleman---to add a namespace. I'd
   always had this but now I am forcing Rob to do so as well.
