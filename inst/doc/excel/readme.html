<EM>PAM is a technique for sample classification from microarray
data. This new package features an Excel interface, designed and
written by Balasubramanian Narasimhan, with help from Trevor Hastie
and Rob Tibshirani. It uses R functions written by Trevor Hastie and
Rob Tibshirani.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="sec:intro"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction </A> </H2>


<P>PAM implements the <EM>Nearest Shrunken Centroid</EM> method of
Tibshirani, Hastie, Narasimhan and Chu (May 14, 2002) described in
<A HREF="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/99/10/6567">Diagnosis of multiple cancer types by shrunken centroids of gene expression</A>.</P>

<P>Note that there are a number of steps in the installation but all are
simple and steps 1-4 need to be done only once. They involve
installation of the R package, and the <CODE>pamr</CODE> package, both of
which are used by <EM>PAM for Excel</EM>.</P>

<P>After these steps, PAM can be used from within your version of
Excel.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>This document describes the installation and use of the <EM>PAM for R</EM>
package. This document is always kept up-to-date at 
<A HREF="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/Rdist/readme.html">The PAM Page</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="sec:install"></A> <A NAME="s2">2. Installing <EM>PAM for Excel</EM> </A></H2>


<P>
<OL>
<LI>You first need to install a recent  version of the R statistical
package. This is free, and can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.cran.r-project.org">The R Project</A>.
<P>Follow the instructions. Click on 
<A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN</A> under
Download. Pick a mirror closest to you. You probably want a
pre-compiled version. For windows, choose the 
<B>Windows (95 or later)</B> link, select <CODE>base</CODE>, and download <CODE>SetupR.exe</CODE>.
Installation takes 5-10 minutes. </P>

<P>R is a great package, and is worth knowing about!</P>

</LI>
<LI>Download the Windows version of <CODE>pamr</CODE> from the 
<A HREF="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/Rdist/index.html">PAM for R Website</A>. Note that <EM>PAM for Excel</EM> and <EM>PAM
for R</EM> are matched packages and one should therefore make sure that
same versions of both packages are installed, for example, version
1.12. When you download the R package, most browsers offer you a
choice of opening the file or saving it. Elect to save it and remember
the name of the folder where you saved it.
<P>Double click on the R icon on your desktop, pull down the
<CODE>Packages</CODE> menu item and select 
<CODE>Install packages from local zip file</CODE>. A file chooser dialog will
allow you to select the file 
<CODE>pamr_1012.zip</CODE> that you just saved in the previous step.</P>

</LI>
<LI>If you have an older version of <EM>PAM for Excel</EM> already on
your computer, remove it using <CODE>Add/Remove Programs</CODE> in your
control panel, before installing the newer version.
<P>Go to the 
<A HREF="http://www-stat-class.stanford.edu/~tibs/clickwrap/pam.html">PAM for Excel Registration page</A> and then follow instructions
to download the <CODE>pam_1012.zip</CODE> file. Unzip it and click on the
<CODE>Setup</CODE> icon to install it.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Fire up Excel, go to the <CODE>Tools</CODE> menu and choose  <CODE>Addin</CODE>.
Browse to find the Addin file that the installation in the previous
step installed. Unless you changed the default on installation, it is
usually placed in the directory
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
C:\Program files\PAMVB\Addin\pam.xla
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Click <CODE>OK</CODE>, and now you should see a <CODE>PAM</CODE> and <CODE>PAM
controller</CODE> button on the top of your Excel window. You might have SAM
installed already- that's OK! They can co-exist in your Excel.
</LI>
</OL>

The above concludes the installation process and needs to be done just
once. </P>

<P>The data setup for PAM is much like that for SAM. There is one line
per gene. There are additional rows at the top of the spreadsheet for
class labels and (optional) sample and batch labels. Example files
have been provided for you. For example the file </P>

</P>
<P>Load up this example, click on the <CODE>PAM</CODE> button and you should see
a <CODE>PAM Dialog</CODE>. Specify the following inputs:
<UL>
<LI> Class Labels in selection row: 2</LI>
<LI> Sample Labels in selection row: 1</LI>
<LI> Batch Labels in selection row:  (leave blank)</LI>
<LI> Expression Data starts in selection row: 3</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Click <CODE>OK</CODE> to start the PAM analysis. </P>

<P>A detailed manual for PAM is available in the directory 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
C:\Program Files\PAMVB\doc\pam.pdf
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>It also contains the above installation
instructions and a lot more detail. Any serious user of PAM should
refer to it.</P>
